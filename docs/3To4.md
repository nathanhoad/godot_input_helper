# Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x

## Device detecting

- The `gamepad_changed(device_index: int, is_connected: bool)` signal is now `joypad_changed(device_index: int, is_connected: bool)`.

## Input Mapping

### Keyboard and mouse

- The `action_key_changed(action: String, key: String)` signal is now `keyboard_input_changed(action: String, input: InputEvent)`.
- The `action_mouse_button_changed(action: String, button: MouseButton)` signal has been removed and is now part of `keyboard_input_changed`.
- `set_action_key_or_button(action: String, event: InputEvent)` is now ` set_keyboard_or_joypad_input_for_action(action: String, event: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)`.
- `get_action_key_or_button(action: String)` is now `get_keyboard_or_joypad_input_for_action(action: String)` and now returns an `InputEvent`.
- `InputHelper.get_action_keys(action: String)` is now `get_keyboard_inputs_for_action(action: String)` and now returns an array of `InputEvent`s.
- `get_action_key(action: String)` is now `get_keyboard_input_for_action(action: String)` and now returns an InputEvent.
- `set_action_key(action: String, key: String, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `set_keyboard_input_for_action(action: String, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEvent` as the new value.
- `replace_action_key(action: String, current_key: String, next_key: String, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `replace_action_key(action: String, current_input: InputEvent, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEvent` as the new value.
- `replace_action_key_at_index(action: String, index: int, next_key: String, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `replace_keyboard_input_at_index(action: String, index: int, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEvent` as the new value.
- All mouse input mapping is now part of the keyboard mapping.

### Joypads

- The `action_button_changed(action: String, button: JoyButton)` signal is now `joypad_input_changed(action: String, input: InputEventJoypadButton)`.
- `get_action_buttons(action: String)` is now `get_joypad_inputs_for_action(action: String)` and now returns an array of `InputEvent`s.
- `get_action_button(action: String)` is now `get_joypad_input_for_action(action: String)` and now returns an `InputEvent`.
- `set_action_button(action: String, button: JoyButton, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `set_joypad_input_for_action(action: String, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEventJoypadButton` as the new value.
- `replace_action_button(action: String, current_button: JoyButton, next_button: JoyButton, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `replace_joypad_input_for_action(action: String, current_input: InputEvent, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEventJoyButton` as the new value.
- `replace_action_button_at_index(action: String, index: int, next_button: JoyButton, swap_if_taken: bool)` is now `replace_joypad_input_at_index(action: String, index: int, input: InputEvent, swap_if_taken: bool)` and now takes an `InputEventJoyButton` as the new value.
